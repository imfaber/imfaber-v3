                    I am <strong>Fabrizio Meinero</strong> (web name <strong>Imfaber</strong> ), a freelance web developer based in Madrid (Spain) but also active in the UK and Italy.<br>
                    With over 10 years of commercial experience my skills are broad: from front-end to back-end, from UI/UX to devops. I enjoy every aspect of web development, and love building web sites & apps from start to end, for clients all over the world.
